      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/PassportPhoto.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Hello.  I'm Susan, an education professional, jokester, baker, amateur woodworker, book reader, British period piece watcher, and a web developer&#40;ish&#41;.  Through this website, I hope to exhibit my growing porfolio as I complete coding boot camp.</p>

      <p>I was born in rural Illinois, went to college in Indianapolis, IN-graduating with a degree in both Spanish and Education-and from there moved to Spain to teach English for a few years and work on my own Spanish language skills.</p>

      <p>I made the decision to come back to the US to start a career.  While I had originally envisioned working as a high school Spanish teacher, I eventually realized that I wanted to have an impact outside the classroom.  I now work for a world-class teaching hostpital managing the operations for their Graduate Medical Education Program, helping all the residency and fellowship programs to run and for trainees to become fully fledged physicians in their chosen specialty.</p>

       <p>My favorite pastimes are baking &#40;I'm always chasing the perfect French macaron recipe&#41;, reading, watching wonderfully horrible British television, and trying to make functional wooden furniture with my two hands.</p>
